## 🧪 Introduction

This study utilizes satellite imagery to analyze the sustainability of the Tapi River, focusing on turbidity levels and river width changes. It contributes to:

- **Goal 14** (Life Below Water)  
- **Goal 11** (Sustainable Cities and Communities)  
- **Goal 15** (Life on Land)  
- **Goal 6** (Clean Water and Sanitation)  
- **Goal 3** (Good Health and Well-being)  
- **Goal 13** (Climate Action)  

Understanding these dynamics aids in pollution control, urban planning, and conservation efforts for sustainable river management.

## 📊 Research Methodology

**Data Source**: Sentinel-2 satellite imagery  
**Techniques**:
- **Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI)**: Assessing water quality  
- **Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)**: Identifying water bodies  
- **Heatmap Analysis**: Identifying high and low turbidity zones  
- **Historical Analysis**: River width variations from 1987 to 2021  

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

### 1. Turbidity Trends (2019-2023)

- Highest turbidity at Dabholi Bridge (May 2023)  
- Lowest turbidity at Dummas Road-2 (January 2023)  
- Post-monsoon peaks (October-December), declines in winter & summer  
- Stable zones: Kathor, Savji Korat Bridge  
- Fluctuating zones: Amboli

### 2. River Width Variability (1987-2021)

- Widest point: Jahangirpura (2002)  
- Narrowest point: Gorat (2020)  
- Stable areas: Kamrej, Rustombaug to Adajan Bridge  
- Significant fluctuations: Jahangirpura, Variyav Bridge to Dabholi Bridge
