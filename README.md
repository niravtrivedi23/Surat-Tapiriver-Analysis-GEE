## 📌 Tapi River Insights: Sustainable Water Management

### Project Overview
This repository contains the research work **"Tapi River Sustainability: Surat's Lifeline and Beyond"**, conducted by students of **M.Sc. (Applied Statistics)** semester-4 at **Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (V.N.S.G.U.)**, Surat, Gujarat.

**Project Group:**
- **Trivedi Nirav**  
- **Dekani Nikunjkumar**  
- **Mayat Sadiya**  
- **Rakholiya Dhruvi**  
- **Sukla Atish**  

**Project Guide**: Sahil Merai  
**Project Year**: 2023-24

##  Introduction

This study utilizes satellite imagery to analyze the sustainability of the Tapi River, focusing on turbidity levels and river width changes. It contributes to:

- **Goal 14** (Life Below Water)  
- **Goal 11** (Sustainable Cities and Communities)  
- **Goal 15** (Life on Land)  
- **Goal 6** (Clean Water and Sanitation)  
- **Goal 3** (Good Health and Well-being)  
- **Goal 13** (Climate Action)  

Understanding these dynamics aids in pollution control, urban planning, and conservation efforts for sustainable river management.

##  Study Area: Tapi River, Surat City

Surat is a major commercial hub in Gujarat, where the **Tapi River spans ~20 km. Remote sensing** plays a vital role in tracking water quality and changes, supporting conservation efforts.

---

## 📊 Research Methodology

**Data Source**: Sentinel-2 satellite imagery  
**Techniques**:
- **Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI)**: Assessing water quality  
- **Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)**: Identifying water bodies  
- **Heatmap Analysis**: Identifying high and low turbidity zones  
- **Historical Analysis**: River width variations from 1987 to 2021  

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

### 1. Turbidity Trends (2019-2023)

- **Highest turbidity** at **Dabholi Bridge (May 2023)**  
- **Lowest turbidity** at **Dummas Road-2 (January 2023)**  
- **Post-monsoon peaks (October-December), declines in winter & summer**  
- **Stable zones**: Kathor, Savji Korat Bridge  
- **Fluctuating zones**: Amboli

### 2. River Width Variability (1987-2021)

- **Widest point**: Jahangirpura (2002)  
- **Narrowest point**: Gorat (2020)  
- **Stable areas**: Kamrej, Rustombaug to Adajan Bridge  
- **Significant fluctuations**: Jahangirpura, Variyav Bridge to Dabholi Bridge

## 🌐 SDG Alignment

- **Goal 14**: Monitoring water quality and pollution control  
- **Goal 11**: Sustainable urban planning along the river  
- **Goal 15**: Biodiversity conservation and ecosystem health  
- **Goal 6**: Ensuring clean water supply  
- **Goal 3**: Reducing health risks linked to water pollution  
- **Goal 13**: Adapting to climate-driven river changes  

---

##  Policy Recommendations

- **Integrated River Management**: Combining pollution control and urban planning  
- **Stricter Water Quality Standards**: Regular monitoring and enforcement  
- **Sustainable Riverfront Development**: Eco-friendly urban infrastructure  
- **Public Awareness**: Educating communities on river conservation  
- **Remote Sensing-Based Decision Making**: Using real-time data for policy action  

---

##  Future Work & Recommendations

- **Long-Term Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of river width and turbidity  
- **Expanded Water Quality Assessments**: Identifying pollution hotspots  
- **IoT-Based Monitoring**: Deploying sensors for real-time data collection  
- **Sustainable Urban Development**: Enhancing green infrastructure along stable riverfront areas  

---

## ✅ Conclusion

The research highlights the critical need for **sustainable water management** using remote sensing. Surat must prioritize water conservation efforts, strict pollution controls, and data-driven policy-making to ensure the Tapi River’s long-term health.
